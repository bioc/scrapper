Title: Bindings to C++ Libraries for Single-Cell Analysis
Description: 
    Implements R bindings to C++ code for analyzing single-cell (expression) data, mostly from various libscran libraries. 
    Each function performs an individual step in the single-cell analysis workflow, ranging from quality control to clustering and marker detection.
    It is mostly intended for other Bioconductor package developers to build more user-friendly end-to-end workflows.
